# Contributing to the Kitchen
So you want to increase the capabilities of the TV Kitchen, welcome!

This document will expand.  For now before opening a Pull Request
please be sure that...

1. Your code passes the linter and doesn't break everything.
2. You have [opened an issue](https://github.com/slifty/tvkitchen/issues) to explain your goals.

There isn't a process beyond that yet, but we'll build it out as
needed.
